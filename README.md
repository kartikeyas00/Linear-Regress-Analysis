# Analysis of different methods and ways of Linear Regression in Python.

*Introduction*  
Linear regression is finding a line which best fits a set of data. Here we will be talking about the linear regression with only two variables, independent and the response variable.  
With two variables the typical equation of the regrssion line, which is also called the regression equation looks like  **Y=mX+b** where Y is the dependent variable and X is the independent variable.
 
 Examples of Linear regressions -:
 1. Predicting house prices in a city on the basis of the area of the house.
        In this case the area of the house is independent variable and the 
        housing price is a dependent variable.
 2. Predicting tax rate on the basis of the per capita income of a country,
        In this case the per capita income is the independent variable and the 
        tax rate is the dependent variable.
